                <p>Your website is your most powerful digital marketing tool. When it is no longer perfoming, then it's time you start thinking about redesigning your website. This can be a hard decision for businesses to know when it's the time for a website
                    redesign.
                </p>
                <p>So, we have put together a list of 6 signs to help you know if it's time to redesign your website.</p>
                <h1>1. &nbsp;Your website is difficult to navigate and find information</h1>
                <p>Your website's navigation structure is a critical element. It should allow your website visitors to find out where they are, where they have been, and direct them where to go. If your website's visitors can't figure out how to find the
                    information they need, then you lose leads on your site.</p>
                <p>How do you know if your site's navigation is easy to use.</p>
                <p>To find out, one way is to test it yourself. You can consider yourself as one of your website's visitor looking for a particular product or information. For example, if you're an ecommerce, you can visit a product page and purchase an
                    item.
                </p>
                <p>You can also navigate from your website's homepage through the other pages, or you can ask a friend to try navigate your site and ask for feedback on how the feel and experience your site.</p>
                <h1>2. &nbsp;Your current website visitors are not converting to sales.</h1>
                <p>Your business website should be designed to drive leads and convert them to sales. Your site visitors should navigate easily through your site, check out your information, products or services, and make purchases. If your website is having
                    difficulty doing that, then you may need a website redesign serice.</p>
                <p>For your website to increase conversion rates, it needs some critical elements, which can range from easy navigation structure, adding effective call to action (CTA) button in your website pages. These elements can get you from losing
                    leads to earning conversions.</p>
                <p>At Crosint, we can help you maximize your conversion rates and improve your ROI.</p>

                <p>Visit your competitors' websites today and see if it looks modern, recently updated and if it's easier to navigate, then compare it with your site. If your site is lagging behind, you may already be losing potential customers, and definitely
